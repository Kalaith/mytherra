> **🔄 Backend Migration Complete**: Mytherra has been successfully migrated from Node.js/TypeScript to PHP, featuring enhanced architecture with the Actions pattern, comprehensive models, and expanded game mechanics.

---therra

**Mytherra** is a **web-based god simulation game** where players share a single evolving world. As minor deities, players place divine bets on the fate of heroes and civilizations, subtly influencing outcomes to earn favor and glory.

The world is destined to end — whether by demonic invasion, magical apocalypse, or a hero’s hubris. But every ending gives rise to a new **Era**, where echoes of the past shape the future.

## 🌟 Concept Summary

You are one of many gods watching the world from beyond. You cannot command mortals, but you may bet on their rise, influence their fate, and shape the grand story — without ever writing it yourself.

- The world is shared by **all players**.
- **Bets** cost divine influence and reward insight and foresight.
- You **cannot directly control outcomes**, only tilt the odds in your favor.
- The **world ends** — always — leading to a **new Era** with fresh rules, heroes, and magic.

---

## 🔄 Era System

### 🌋 Inevitable Cataclysms
Each world culminates in a climactic event:
- Demonic conquest  
- A hero goes rogue and destroys everything  
- The magical fabric collapses  
- Divine war severs realms

These events conclude an **Era**.

### 🌱 Rebirth & Renewal
After cataclysm, the world enters a **new Era**:
- Rules evolve
- New factions, regions, and magic appear
- Player influence carries over through legacy

### 🌀 Legacy & Continuity
- **Reincarnating Heroes**: Some return with echoes of their former selves
- **Textual References**: Books, ruins, or prophecies recall past Eras
- **Era Logs**: Major events preserved for divine study
- **Long-term Bets**: Influence cross-Era outcomes (e.g., "This hero’s line will return to rule again")

---

## 🧱 Core Features

### 🗺️ Dynamic Regions
- Procedurally generated with unique names and traits
- Track **Prosperity**, **Chaos**, and **Magic Affinity**
- Regions evolve, decay, or transform across Eras

### 🧙 Emergent Heroes
- Spawn based on regional needs or crises
- Take on roles: warrior, scholar, prophet, tyrant
- May die, succeed, or ascend — and **some may reincarnate**

### 🔮 Divine Betting System
- Spend **Divine Influence** to place bets:
  - “This hero will reach level 100”
  - “That region will be corrupted within 10 years”
  - “This bloodline will return in the next Era”
- Influence the world through omens, guidance, or blessings
- Winning bets grant Divine Favor and unlock prestige

### ✨ Hidden Magical Systems
- Magic is modular, mysterious, and discovered organically
- Players can nudge heroes toward discovery
- Magic systems evolve with each Era

### 📜 Systemic Storytelling
- No pre-written plot — the world evolves based on internal logic and divine nudges
- Eras become chapters in a greater saga
- Past events leave permanent marks: cursed forests, ruined capitals, legendary tombs

---

## 💡 Design Goals

- **Shared World**: One living, persistent simulation for all players
- **Emergent Narrative**: Stories arise from systems, not scripts
- **Cyclical Structure**: Worlds always end — and begin again
- **Minimal Direct Control**: Players are gods, not puppeteers
- **Long-Term Engagement**: Legacy systems reward consistency and clever long bets
- **Expandable via Eras**: Each new Era introduces fresh mechanics, balance changes, or features

---

## 🧭 Design Philosophy: "Narrative Through Systems"

- 🧠 *Predict, not control.* You shape probability, not destiny.
- 🔁 *Endings matter.* Death is meaningful. Eras give closure and renewal.
- 🪄 *Magic is a mystery.* Heroes discover what even gods do not know — until it’s too late.
- 🧬 *Continuity breeds richness.* Echoes of past Eras give meaning to the present.
- 🧠 *Player stories emerge naturally.* No two timelines are ever the same.

The backend follows a modern PHP architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components

1. **Routes (`Routes/`)**: Defines all API endpoints using Slim Framework.
   - `api.php`: All RESTful API endpoints for regions, heroes, events, betting, influence, and game status

2. **Controllers (`Controllers/`)**: Handle HTTP request processing and response generation.
   - `EventController.php`: Event lookup and creation
   - `StatusController.php`: Game state management  
   - `HeroController.php`: Hero retrieval and modification
   - `InfluenceController.php`: Player influence processing
   - `RegionController.php`: Region data handling
   - `BettingController.php`: Divine betting system
   - `BuildingController.php`: Building management
   - `LandmarkController.php`: Landmark discovery and management

3. **Actions (`Actions/`)**: Contains the business logic and state mutation functions.
   - `EventActions.php`: Event creation and processing
   - `HeroActions.php`: Hero mechanics and behavior  
   - `InfluenceActions.php`: Player divine influence logic
   - `RegionActions.php`: Region state and evolution
   - `BettingActions.php`: Divine betting mechanics
   - `SettlementActions.php`: Settlement evolution and management

4. **Models (`Models/`)**: Define the data structures using Eloquent ORM.
   - `GameEvent.php`: World event schema
   - `GameState.php`: Overall game state
   - `Hero.php`: Hero entity schema
   - `Region.php`: World region schema
   - `DivineBet.php`: Betting system schema
   - `Building.php`, `Settlement.php`, `Landmark.php`: World structure entities

5. **Services (`Services/`)**: Core game services and complex business logic.
   - `GameLoopService.php`: World simulation and time advancement
   - `DivineBettingService.php`: Betting system mechanics
   - `DivineInfluenceService.php`: Player influence calculations
   - `HeroLifecycleService.php`: Hero creation, aging, and death
   - `GameConfigService.php`: Game configuration management

6. **External (`External/`)**: Repository pattern for data access abstraction.

7. **Utils (`Utils/`)**: Helper functions and utilities for various game systems.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mytherra.git
    cd mytherra
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    
    **Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend && npm install
    ```
    
    **Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend && composer install
    ```

3.  **Environment Setup**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your database credentials
    ```

4.  **Initialize Database**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    php scripts/initializeDatabase.php
    ```

5.  **Run Backend**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    php -S localhost:8000 -t public
    ```

6.  **Run Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    
The backend will run on port 8000 by default, and the frontend will run on port 5173 with Vite's development server.

## 📘 Example Lore Snippet

A scholar named Elvarwyn uncovered remnants of a forgotten star-language in the ruins of Cryspire. Her discovery led to the rise of celestial magic, forever changing the world's understanding of the skies. Centuries later, star cults worship her as the First Seeker.
